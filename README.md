This repository holds a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C that two people can play on one computer. The game uses a 3x3 grid where players take turns putting their marks, either 'X' or 'O'. 
The goal is to get three of your marks in a row either up and down, across, or diagonally to win. The program updates the board right after each player makes a move, checks to make sure the moves are
allowed, and looks for a winner after each turn. If a player lines up three marks, the game announces who won. If all spots are filled and no one has won, it says the game is a draw.
The game is easy to play using a simple text window that shows the board and lets players type their moves.
